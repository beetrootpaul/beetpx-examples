# BeetPx Input Tester

This tool serves as a **quick way to test game inputs supported by
[BeetPx game engine](https://beetpx.dev)**, both keyboard ones and 
gamepads. The latter are especially important
here, since the key mapping varies between game controllers, 
web browsers and operating systems.

The **dashed line** at the edge of the canvas indicate which game input type
(a keyboard or a gamepad) was detected the last. The way it could be
leveraged in a real game would be to show either keyboard or gamepad
controls to the player depending on what do they use to play the game.

When in **debug mode** (entered with a semicolon on the keyboard),
the alternative screen appears, showing details of up to 3 connected 
game controllers. What it presents are detected gamepad
buttons. First, there are two rows of regular buttons
(with a colored square indicating the full press was detected
and a cross/plus indicated a half-press).
Next, there are 7 axis of precise "buttons" like D-pad 
or triggers.

In the debug mode, there is also an indication of a detected 
gamepad type, as well as a detected web browser (and whether 
it's Windows or not, when it comes to Firefox). Those are
dictated by differences between gamepad mappings I experienced so far.

This tool is supposed to work correctly on a **mobile web browser**
as well.
